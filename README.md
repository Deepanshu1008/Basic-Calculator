# Basic Calculator
A simple calculator app built using ReactJS, showcasing fundamental concepts such as Module CSS, Props passing, hooks (specifically useState()), and parent-child behavior through event bubbling.

## Concepts Covered
- [Modular CSS](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/) : Styles are organized using module CSS for better maintainability and encapsulation.

- [Props](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) : Components communicate through the passing of props, allowing for a clear flow of data.

- [State Management](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state) : Utilizes React hooks, specifically useState(), for efficient state management within functional components.

- [Parent-Child Interaction](https://medium.com/@livajorge7/introduction-9e84391f4b83) : Demonstrates the parent-child relationship in React components, showcasing event bubbling for communication between components.

- [Repaint Trigger](https://medium.com/swlh/what-the-heck-is-repaint-and-reflow-in-the-browser-b2d0fb980c08) : Utilizes concepts like state changes to trigger component repaints for a responsive user interface.
